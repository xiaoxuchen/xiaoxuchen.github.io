<!-- <br> -->
Welcome! I am Xiaoxu Chen (陈晓旭), a Postdoctoral Fellow in Logistics and Operations Management at HEC Montréal, working with Prof. [Yossiri Adulyasak](https://sites.google.com/site/ayossiri/home) and Prof. [Jean-François Cordeau](https://www.hec.ca/en/profs/jean-francois.cordeau.html) on stochastic optimization in supply chain management. Before joining HEC Montréal, I worked with Prof. [Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/) and Prof. [Martin Trépanier](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/trepanier-martin) on statistical models with applications in transportation.

## Research interests

I am interested in **statistics** and **optimization** for **transportation** and **supply chain management**. Currently, I am particularly interested in discrete choice models, spatiotemporal data modeling, and data-driven optimization under uncertainty. In the domain of transportation, I focus on probabilistic demand and travel time forecasting, statistical inference of origin-destination matrices (inverse problem), and statistical modeling of driving behavior. In supply chain management, I explore problems such as statistical demand modeling and stochastic multi-echelon inventory optimization, with an emphasis on incorporating uncertainty into decision-making processes.
