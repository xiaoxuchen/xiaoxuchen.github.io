Cheng, Z., Tr√©panier, M., & Sun, L. (2020). [Probabilistic model for destination inference and travel pattern mining from smart card data](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11116-020-10120-0). Transportation, 1-19.

This is my first first-authored paper. But I made a typo in major equations ü§£. The paper has been published and cannot be modified. Luckily, this typo does not affect results and conclusions.

For Equation (1) in the paper, the two circled $z^t$ should be $z^o$ and $z^d$ respectively. The Equation (2) in the paper should also be modified accordingly.
